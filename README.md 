## Project Overview

The **AI Smartphone Recommender** is a web-based application that helps users find the best smartphone based on their preferences.
It combines:

- Classic feature-based scoring (price, RAM, battery, camera, display, weight, release year)
- Semantic natural language understanding
- Satisfaction-driven recommendation (user preference optimization)

The system also provides **explainable recommendations**, showing why each phone was chosen and highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
